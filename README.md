# Etch A Sketch 
<ul>
  <li>Etch A Sketch is a mechanical toy which uses a stylus for making drawings </li>
  <li>The toy has aluminium powder coating which displaces when the stylus runs over it, creating a line</li>
  <li>We try to simulate this by creating a user defined size grid and filling each element of the grid as the cursor moves over it</li>
  <li>The toy was reset just by shaking it, we will not shake our computers however, a reset button should do the job</li>
</ul>
